Some college projects code in Java:

0 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
  * Recursion, Divide and Conquer, PRIM-MST, Recursion+Loop
1 - Advance Data Structures.
  * Trees, HashMap, Sets, Graphs, List...

----------Design and Analysis of Algorithms:

On this project/class:

We implement different concepts and problems that allows us to learn new techniques of programming.

1-Recursion. Different types and Algorithms like Horner.
2-Divide and Conquer... similar to quick sort algorithm.
3-Multiple Knapsack... Optimization Concept.
4-PRIM (MST) ... A good way to find the best route possible in a graph or tree.


For the next projects, we received different implementations from trees, hashtable, graph and we have to add different methods without change the given structures and create new applications.

---------- Advance Data Structures.
# Project1: LinkedTree, LCRS-Tree and ArrayList and LinkedList structures.

On this project we have to create a Java App that allows a user to input a directory URL, and the application get the data from that directory like space, and create a tree with the subdirectories and files and let you go down or up in the tree.

In file LinkedTreePlus.java file, we create the front() "leaf", depth() and degree() of a tree. And the same methods for the LCRSTree implementation in the file LCRSTreePlus.java.

# Project2: HashTable Map - Sets, List structures...

On this project we have a database or a directory with news in text format and we have to process all this news and get the key words and common words of every news.

We create a special solver design for collision when we are trying to add new entries to the hashtable. Also, we implement the HastTableMapSC.java and the
findEntry(K key) in the HashTableMap.java.

This project helps us to understand much more the functionality of the structure hashtable and hashmap.

# Project3: BinarySearchTree, AVL tree structures

On this project we create a simple game call "guess" animals using the structures given by the teacher.

# Project4: Sets, List, Arrays structures...

On this project we have to develop the 3 differents graphs implementations:
1- Adjacency List
2- Adjacency Matrix
3- Edge List

We have to use graph and Di-graph too. Also Weighted Edges...

This implementation is not finished... But the concepts and methods are clear.
